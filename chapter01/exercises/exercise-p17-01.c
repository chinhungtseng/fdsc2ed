/* Exercise 1
   
   Consider the two statements:
   (a) Is n = 2 the largest value of n for which there exist 
       positive integers x, y, and z such that x^n + y^n = z^n \ has a solution?
   (b) Store 5 divided y zero into x and go to statement 10.

   Both fail to satisfy one of the five criteria of an algorithm.
   Which criterion do they violate? 
   
   (a) definiteness
   (b) divided by zero is mathematically undefined.  */
